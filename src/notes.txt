1. useState - Your main workhorse

Store the list of todos
Track input field value
Handle filter states (all/active/completed)
Manage edit mode

2. useEffect - For persistence

Save todos to localStorage whenever they change
Load saved todos when app starts

3. useRef (optional but helpful)

Auto-focus input fields
Focus edit inputs when editing a todo

4. useCallback (optional, for optimization)

Prevent unnecessary re-renders when passing functions to child components
Only needed if you split your app into multiple components
